A project using the UK REF data sets to collaborativelly re-rank the publishing venues in Computer Science

### Objective
The UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) that took place in 2014 was a peer-reviewed process that attempted to objectively rank UK Higher Education academic departments based on the quality of their research. Academic staff from each department were asked to submit their top four outputs from between 2009 and 2014 for peer review. The submitted pieces were reviewed -- at great expense (of time and money) -- and the departments were ranked based on the opinions of the reviewers. These submissions, as well as the outcomes, can be accessed from the [REF 2014 website](http://results.ref.ac.uk/DownloadSubmissions).

Despite being peer-reviewed, the REF process was not uncontroversial: A number of top UK scientists devoted a very large amount of time to evaluating the thousands of submitted works; the final judgements of quality depend on what is still a relatively small college of experts and may still contain biases; the task of selecting the experts to sit on [the expert panels](http://www.ref.ac.uk/panels/panelmembership/) implies a pre-existing judgement of research quality. The [final rankings produced](https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/sites/default/files/Attachments/2014/12/17/g/o/l/sub-14-01.pdf) were widely discussed.

*Was all of this expense necessary?*

We note that the in mere act of selecting papers for review, authors and institutions are inherently making a value judgement about the quality of their recent work. No-one is going to choose low quality work to submit. Thus, it can be assumed that, for any particular author, the works selected tend to be of a higher quality than works that they did not choose to include.

This selection enables us to perform an independent evaluation of both publication venues, and hence academic institutions. By aggregating over the subjective qualty decisions of tens of institutions and hundreds of authors, we create a participatory ranking system. We show that, when applied to the field of Computer Science, this peer-to-peer ranking reproduces some of the findings of the REF, whilst also creating some surprises.
